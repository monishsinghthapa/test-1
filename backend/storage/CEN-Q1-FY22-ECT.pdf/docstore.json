The guidance\nfor each metric excludes the same or similar items as those that are excluded from the historical non-GAAP financial measures, as\nwell as significant items that are outside the control of the Company or inherently unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-\nrecurring or non-cash in nature.  For fiscal year 2022, we have defined the non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted free cash flow as\nnet cash provided by operating activities, excluding other significant unpredictable or non-recurring cash payments or receipts\nrelating to legal settlements, minus capital expenditures.  For the three months ended December 31, 2021 adjusted free cash flow of\n$808.9 million consisted of net cash provided by operating activities of $863.4 million minus capital expenditures of $79.7 million\nplus legal settlement payments of $25.2 million.  The Company does not provide forward looking guidance on a GAAP basis for such\nmetrics because certain financial information, the probable significance of which cannot be determined, is not available and cannot\nbe reasonably estimated.  For example, LIFO expense (credit) is largely dependent upon the future inflation or deflation of brand and\ngeneric pharmaceuticals, which is out of the Company\u2019s control, and acquisition-related intangibles amortization depends on the\ntiming and amount of future acquisitions, which cannot be reasonably estimated.
