Happy to talk about the Pharma business.  First,  just let me repeat a little bit \nof what I said in my prepared remarks, which is we are really pleased with the performance of the \nPharma business  and what the team is accomplishing in that core part of our business, the resiliency \nand the strength that th ey showed in Q3 based on the progress on the generics platform, as well as \nsome strength in the brand portfolio and the double -digit growth in specialty allowed us to be able to \nlean forward and raise our guidance for the year for the Pharma business.  \n \n I want to highlight a couple of things as you think about Q4, which I think was the point of your question, \nwhich is, while we expect to see continued good news relative to the operational performance and a \nstable macro environment with the strong underlying fundamentals we laid out, it is important to note \nthat Q4 last year was a strong quarter for us and so we're lapping a higher point.  It's also the case that \nwe'll have less benefit from some non -recurring items that we called out in our prepared remarks ea rlier \nas well.  And so, overall, strong performance in Q3, looking forward to a good Q4 .
